And they really do want one.\nA professional against their demand, Landon spends their days begrudgingly preparing for one of the worst jobs of their life, in their opinion. They just want to chill out for a while and do nothing, perhaps for an extended amount of time (one "businessweek").\nOn the more outward-facing hand, they do appreciate the good looks of the average business suit, and they absolutely do wear one almost all of the time, even if they\'re not on the clock.\nGlasses are a must too.',

It isn't his fault, he was just born this way. It is what it is.\nSpeaking of, \"It is what it is.\" is kind of his tagline. He says it anytime a minor/major inconvenience happens to him, because that's what he truly believes. Over and over, it doesn't matter if he repeats it.\nGenuinely, he is scared for his life. He can't help his own situation, and he can't make any friends without them being considered felons as well. He has seen the mass culling of his generation and has ran for basically all his life.\nOh, well. It is what it is.",
